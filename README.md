There are a few variants of mechanical CAD that we have released:

 - OpenSCAD - This is a parametric model using OpenSCAD (https://openscad.org),
   designed to be easy to edit and 3D print.

 - Printable - These are 2D drawings and 3D CAD of an lid-less card enclosure
   that is designed to be easy to either 3D print, CNC, or injection mold.
   There is a version designed for use of self-tapping M2 screws, and also a
   version that can accomodate M2 threaded inserts.

## Getting Expansion Card Enclosures Fabricated

We've designed the enclosures to be printable on home 3D printers using PLA filament.

If you don't have a 3D printer, it's also easy to order enclosures from the various
printing services that are out there.  Because Expansion Cards are tiny, it is 
extremely inexpensive to get cards printed.  We haven't used all of the services below,
but these are some of the popular ones:
 - Shapeways (https://www.shapeways.com/) - HP MJF material
 - Hubs (https://www.hubs.com/) - HP MJF material (has a minimum order quantity)
 - Treatstock (https://www.treatstock.com/) - Range of materials, including PLA
