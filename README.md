- Chipsailing CS971 fingerprint reader ([AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005008493041334.html))
- USB-A to USB-C adapter ([Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/316027558716))

A box cutter and a flat-head screwdriver would suffice. Start from the sides to avoid accidentally damaging any electronic components.

### Getting Expansion Card Enclosures Fabricated

From Framework:

> We've designed the enclosures to be printable on home 3D printers using PLA filament.
>
> If you don't have a 3D printer, it's also easy to order enclosures from the various
> printing services that are out there. Because Expansion Cards are tiny, it is 
> extremely inexpensive to get cards printed. We haven't used all of the services below,
> but these are some of the popular ones:
> - Shapeways (https://www.shapeways.com/) - HP MJF material
> - Hubs (https://www.hubs.com/) - HP MJF material (has a minimum order quantity)
> - Treatstock (https://www.treatstock.com/) - Range of materials, including PLA
